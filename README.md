### by [James Benjamin Pawlik](http://github.com/jbpawlik)

### __Description__
Anagrams and Antigrams is a tool to check whether a word or phrase is an anagram. An anagram is a word or phrase that contains the exact letters as another word or phrase.


### __Technologies Used__
Anagrams and Ambigrams was created in Ruby. Debugging was handled by the Pry gem. Testing was done with the Rspec gem. A custom Ruby script created the project directory and files. The project includes a script file that allows a user to run the project in their terminal.
